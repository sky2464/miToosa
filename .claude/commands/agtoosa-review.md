Read @Docs/AgToosa_Review.md and execute the multi-persona review workflow.

Arguments provided: $ARGUMENTS

Dispatch rules based on arguments:
- No argument → execute the full review: all 4 parallel specialist personas followed by the Simplifier pass.
- `security` → Security Officer persona only: OWASP Top 10 + STRIDE audit, SAST/DAST/Secrets scanning.
- `arch` → Engineering Manager persona only: 500-line limit check, OOP compliance, observability hooks, test coverage.
- `debug` → Iron Law root-cause investigation: hypothesis, reproduction test, regression test for a failing test or bug.
- `cross` → Cross-platform second-opinion guidance: suggest switching to another installed AI platform and re-running review.
- `cross-model` → Cross-model review gate: read-only independent reviewer; follow `Docs/AgToosa_CrossModelReview.md`.

If no arguments were given, run the full flow:
1. Launch 4 parallel specialist reviews (Security Officer, Engineering Manager, CEO/Product Owner, QA Lead) using the Agent tool.
2. Consolidate findings into a unified report sorted by severity (🔴 Critical → 🟡 Warning → 🟢 Passed).
3. Run the Simplifier pass: refactor for clarity, re-run tests.
