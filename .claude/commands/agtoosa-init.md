Read @Docs/AgToosa_Init.md and execute the initialization workflow.

Arguments provided: $ARGUMENTS

Dispatch rules based on arguments:
- No argument → execute the full one-time initialization workflow: scan codebase, validate AI configs, establish Docs/Context/, configure AgToosa.
- `zoom-out` → execute zoom-out only: show call graph, module boundaries, usage sites, and impact analysis for the current focus area.

If no arguments were given, run the full initialization from Docs/AgToosa_Init.md.

On successful completion, print this line verbatim: `Next: /agtoosa-<command> — <rationale>` plus `SYNC:` pulse (see Lifecycle Next-Step Contract)
