Read @Docs/AgToosa_Goal.md and execute the goal clarification sub-workflow.

Arguments provided: $ARGUMENTS

Dispatch rules based on arguments:
- `project <idea>` → clarify the project-level goal and update `Docs/Master-Plan.md`.
- `story <idea>` → clarify a story or feature goal and update the active spec Goal Contract.
- `check` → run a read-only goal clarity and satisfaction check.
- `revise` → revise the current project or story Goal Contract after an approval gate.
- No argument → infer whether the user means project or story goal; if unclear, ask one question.

This is an optional utility/sub-workflow, not a main lifecycle command. Main workflows may call it when intent, success condition, or proof of completion is unclear.
