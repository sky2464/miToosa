## Codex prompt routing

This file is the Codex project prompt for `/agtoosa-catalog`. When the user invokes `/agtoosa-catalog`, execute the AgToosa catalog workflow below — do **not** route to `/create-skill` or generate a project skill for AgToosa workflow names.

Read `Docs/AgToosa_Catalog.md` and help the user list, search, inspect, validate, or plan catalog entries.

Installation always uses separate `bash agtoosa.sh --registry install` commands — never install from catalog metadata alone.
