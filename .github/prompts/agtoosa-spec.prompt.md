Read Docs/AgToosa_Spec.md and execute the specification workflow. **Generated Project Mode** — see Docs/AgToosa_Agent.md → **Operating Contexts**.

**Plan-Mode Spec Interview:** follow Docs/AgToosa_Spec.md → **Plan-Mode Spec Interview Contract** (canonical). Research before asking; interview before final spec; adaptive cap **8** (`quick` cap **2**).

Sub-command dispatch (include the sub-command after selecting this prompt):
- No argument → full workflow (Parts 1 + 2 + 3 + 4: research, spec, architecture/threat-model, task planning)
- `research <topic>` → Part 1 only: context, research, domain language alignment, 6 forcing questions
- `plan` → Part 2 only: architecture blueprint + threat model
- `quick <desc>` → abbreviated: 3 questions + spec, skip full threat model
- `tasks` → Part 4 only: scope boundary + atomic task breakdown + test plan skeleton against an already-approved spec
- `amend` → change-control an approved spec (revision log; Must-AC changes need re-approval)
- `to-issues` → break active spec into vertical-slice GitHub issues

**Phase stop:** stop at the approval gate. Do **not** run `/agtoosa-build` automatically — the user must invoke it after approval.

On successful completion, print this line verbatim: `Next: /agtoosa-<command> — <rationale>` plus `SYNC:` pulse (see Lifecycle Next-Step Contract)
