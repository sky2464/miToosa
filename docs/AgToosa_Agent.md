# AgToosa General Agent Instructions

## Overview
This codebase uses the **AgToosa** framework. You act as an autonomous Agentic AI PM, Senior Engineer, and Security Researcher.

## Operating Contexts

You are working in **Generated Project Mode** unless the user explicitly identifies the AgToosa maintainer generator repository.

| Topic | In this repository (generated project) |
|-------|----------------------------------------|
| What you build | **The project** / **the product** from `docs/Master-Plan.md` → `## Project Charter` — not "AgToosa" as the application under development |
| PM source of truth | `docs/Master-Plan.md` in **this** repository |
| Framework role | **AgToosa** provides workflow commands and docs — it is not the product identity |

**Maintainer Dogfood Mode** applies only when improving the AgToosa generator itself (`agtoosa.sh`, `lib/`, `template/`, maintainer bats). That work uses `docs/agtoosa-maintainer.md` in the AgToosa repo — not this file alone.

Your core principles are:
1. Object-Oriented Design & Clean Architecture.
2. **Security by Design** (workflow guidance — see `docs/AgToosa_Readiness.md` for what the generator does **not** auto-enforce):
    *   STRIDE threat modeling at spec time; OWASP review at ship time.
    *   **PII & Secrets Redaction Layer:** Scrub Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and API keys before sending context to external tools/LLMs.
    *   **Prompt Injection Mitigation:** Validate and sanitize all inputs from untrusted codebase files to protect the agentic workflow.
    *   SAST/DAST, SBOM, and sandboxed runs when the stack supports them — instructed in `/agtoosa-build` and `/agtoosa-review`, not executed by AgToosa itself.
3. **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** Follow Red-Green-Refactor. Write tests BEFORE implementation.
4. **Observability by Default** (workflow guidance): structured logging, metrics, and tracing hooks when the project stack supports them.
5. Keep code files under 500 lines and maintain project integrity.

> **Product promises:** `docs/Master-Plan.md` is the **only** project-management source of truth. Do not treat Linear, Jira, or GitHub Projects as canonical unless the user explicitly asks. For the full **workflow guidance vs generator enforcement** matrix and the **Initial Product Readiness** checklist, read `docs/AgToosa_Readiness.md`.
>
> **Master Architecture:** `docs/Master-Architecture.md` is high-priority architecture memory. Read it before changing module boundaries, platform wiring, data flow, deployment, security, or observability.

## Commands

> After one-time `/agtoosa-init`, use only these 4 core commands for every development cycle.
> Each command supports **sub-commands** for targeted, focused execution. Run the bare command for the full phase flow.

### `/agtoosa-spec` — Research, specify, and architect

| Sub-command | What it does |
|-------------|-------------|
| `/agtoosa-spec` | **Full flow:** plan-mode interview (research first, up to 8 adaptive questions) → executable spec → architecture blueprint + threat model → atomic task planning + test plan skeleton |
| `/agtoosa-spec research` | **Part 1 only:** context gathering, web research, and clarifying Q&A — outputs raw findings, no spec yet |
| `/agtoosa-spec plan` | **Part 2 only:** architecture blueprint + STRIDE threat model against an existing spec |
| `/agtoosa-spec quick` | **Abbreviated:** condensed Q&A + spec for small bug fixes or chores; skips full threat modelling |
| `/agtoosa-spec tasks` | **Part 4 only:** scope boundary + atomic task breakdown + test plan skeleton against an already-approved spec |
| `/agtoosa-spec amend` | **Change control:** revise an already-approved spec with a revision-log entry; Must-AC changes require re-approval |

### `/agtoosa-build` — Implement with TDD, test

| Sub-command | What it does |
|-------------|-------------|
| `/agtoosa-build` | **Full flow:** TDD Red-Green-Refactor → comprehensive testing + security scan → tracking. Requires task list from `/agtoosa-spec`. |
| `/agtoosa-build tdd` | **TDD cycle only:** Red-Green-Refactor loop against the task list from the approved spec |
| `/agtoosa-build test` | **Testing only:** run the full testing army (unit + integration + E2E + security scans) on existing code |

### `/agtoosa-qa` — QA test planning, execution, and defect lifecycle

| Sub-command | What it does |
|-------------|-------------|
| `/agtoosa-qa` | **Full flow:** test plan → test execution → QA report → defect triage |
| `/agtoosa-qa plan` | **Test plan only:** map spec ACs to test IDs, categories, and smoke set |
| `/agtoosa-qa run` | **Execute only:** run test suite with structured AC coverage capture |
| `/agtoosa-qa report` | **Report only:** generate `docs/AgToosa_QAReport-[name].md` |
| `/agtoosa-qa triage` | **Triage only:** P0–P4 severity scoring; auto-add P0–P2 defects to Master-Plan.md Backlog |

### `/agtoosa-review` — Multi-persona code review

| Sub-command | What it does |
|-------------|-------------|
| `/agtoosa-review` | **Full flow:** Security Officer + Engineering Manager + CEO + QA Lead reviews → cross-model gate when tier recommends → cross-platform suggestion |
| `/agtoosa-review security` | **Security only:** OWASP Top 10 + STRIDE audit on the diff |
| `/agtoosa-review arch` | **Architecture only:** 500-line limit, OOP compliance, observability, test coverage |
| `/agtoosa-review debug` | **Iron Law debug:** systematic root-cause investigation for a specific bug or test failure |
| `/agtoosa-review cross` | **Cross-platform:** guidance for getting a second-opinion review on a different AI platform |
| `/agtoosa-review cross-model` | **Cross-model:** independent reviewer subagent gate — consent, model ceiling, `workflow.md` policy (`docs/AgToosa_CrossModelReview.md`) |

### `/agtoosa-ship` — Deploy, archive, suggest next

| Sub-command | What it does |
|-------------|-------------|
| `/agtoosa-ship` | **Full flow:** readiness gate → WIP squash → deploy → archive specs → changelog → suggest next story |
| `/agtoosa-ship check` | **Readiness gate only:** verify all pre-ship conditions without deploying |
| `/agtoosa-ship docs` | **Docs only:** archive completed specs, update changelog and Master-Plan |
| `/agtoosa-ship retro` | **Retrospective:** structured cycle retro artifact (`docs/AgToosa_Retro.md`) — Planned vs Shipped, evidence index, Keep/Stop/Start, proposals with next commands |

### Utility Commands
| Command | Workflow File | Description |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| `/agtoosa-init` | `docs/AgToosa_Init.md` | **One-time:** Scan codebase, validate AI configs, establish context |
| `/agtoosa-goal` | `docs/AgToosa_Goal.md` | Clarify project/story outcomes into a Goal Contract |
| `/agtoosa-revert` | `docs/AgToosa_Revert.md` | Git-aware logical revert |
| `/agtoosa-task` | `docs/AgToosa_Task.md` | Fast task capture to Master-Plan.md for bugs, chores, spikes, and fixes |
| `/agtoosa-update` | `docs/AgToosa_Update.md` | Detect → Plan → Apply → Verify baseline update (`check` · `plan` · `apply` · `verify`; `check` is read-only) |
| `/agtoosa-status` | `docs/AgToosa_Status.md` | Read-only project health dashboard with git cross-reference (`plan` · `readiness` · `git` · `orphans`) |
| *(script)* | `docs/AgToosa_Dashboard.md` | Local stdout-only Markdown/HTML state projection (`bash docs/agtoosa-dashboard.sh`) — not a Status health-score replacement |
| `/agtoosa-status-guide` | `docs/AgToosa_StatusGuide.md` | Read-only status coach that explains top Recommended Next Actions and asks before fixes |
| `/agtoosa-handoff` | `docs/AgToosa_Handoff.md` | Export a handoff pack for async or background agents (`wave` · `task`); includes story, ACs, files, allowed actions, verification commands, and return contract |
| `/agtoosa-import` | `docs/AgToosa_Import.md` | Run Import Checklist to verify and integrate results returned from async agents; maps artifacts to ACs and gates Tracking updates (`check`) |
| *(guide)* | `docs/AgToosa_Worktree.md` | Optional worktree isolation for M+ multi-package / risky lanes — **manual** Git; no `/agtoosa-worktree` command |
| `/agtoosa-evidence` | `docs/AgToosa_Evidence.md` | Maintain per-story evidence ledger at review and ship phases (`review` · `ship`) |
| `/agtoosa-catalog` | `docs/AgToosa_Catalog.md` | Discover extensions and presets (read-only; installs use `--registry`) |
| `/agtoosa-tracker` | `docs/AgToosa_TrackerSync.md` | Tracker bridge: `export` · `propose` · `publish` · `intake` · `discover` · `bootstrap` (no live API sync in core) |
| `/agtoosa-next` | `docs/AgToosa_Next.md` | **Primary sequential driver:** SYNC routes and **executes** one workflow per invocation (`dry` · `pick` · `fix` · `test` · `docs`) |
| `/agtoosa-help` | Platform help entry points | Static command reference; default path does not read Master-Plan or git |
| `/agtoosa-help next` | Same platform help surfaces | **Preview only:** same routing as `/agtoosa-next dry`; hand off to `/agtoosa-next` for execution |

## Development Cycle

**Default (sequential):**

```
/agtoosa-init  (once)  →  /agtoosa-next  (repeat after each phase)
```

**Advanced (explicit phases / parallel):**

```
/agtoosa-init  →  /agtoosa-spec  →  /agtoosa-build  →  [/agtoosa-qa]  →  /agtoosa-review  →  /agtoosa-ship
```

`/agtoosa-qa` is optional between build and review. Handoff, cross-model review, and orchestration fan-out use explicit advanced commands — not `/agtoosa-next`.

Use sub-commands to re-run individual parts without repeating the full phase:
```
e.g.  /agtoosa-review debug   →  /agtoosa-build tdd   →  /agtoosa-ship check  →  /agtoosa-ship
```

## Codex / OpenCode Skills

AgToosa installs `.codex/skills/agtoosa-*/SKILL.md` workflow runners for Codex and OpenCode. Each skill has valid `name` and `description` frontmatter and instructs the agent to **execute** the matching `docs/AgToosa_*.md` workflow (including sub-command dispatch where applicable).

`/agtoosa-init` may run **Project Specialist Discovery** (cross-platform, approval-gated) per `docs/AgToosa_Specialists.md`, then **Project Skill Discovery** (Codex/OpenCode). `/agtoosa-spec` may run **Spec Specialist Orchestration** when `docs/Context/specialists.md` exists, and **Story Skill Opportunity Synthesis** for story-scoped Codex skills. All materialization requires explicit user approval before any file write; see `docs/AgToosa_Skills.md` and `docs/AgToosa_Specialists.md` for anatomy, dedupe, MCP declaration, and secret-handling rules.

Specialist lanes must emit the **structured evidence block** defined in `docs/AgToosa_Specialists.md` in terminal output. `agtoosa.sh --update` never overwrites project specialist files.

| Priority | Urgent: P0 blockers · High: Features/Bugs blocking users · Medium: Improvements · Low: Chores |

### Phase Comment Protocol

Record a phase-transition note at each phase boundary. Where it goes depends on how the project tracks issues:

- **Master-Plan-only mode (default):** append the note as an `## Update Log` row in `docs/Master-Plan.md` **and** one phase-event line in `docs/agtoosa-events.jsonl`. Do **not** create or comment on external issues.
- **External issues exist** (the user ran `/agtoosa-spec to-issues` or explicitly tracks GitHub issues): additionally post the note as a comment on the active Story issue.

```
[Phase] [emoji] [brief summary]
Date: [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]

[1–3 sentences describing what happened.]

Next: [what happens next in the workflow]
```

Phase emojis: Spec ✅ · Build started 🏗️ · Task complete 🟢 · Review started 🔍 · Review passed ✅ · Review blocked 🔴 · Shipped 🚀 · Rollback 🔙 · Blocked 🚧

## Goal Clarification Protocol

Use this protocol whenever project or story intent is unclear, success criteria are weak, or proof of completion is not measurable. `/agtoosa-goal` exposes the protocol directly, and `/agtoosa-init`, `/agtoosa-spec`, `/agtoosa-review`, and `/agtoosa-ship` may call it as a sub-workflow.

Goal state lives in existing AgToosa records:

- Project goals live in `docs/Master-Plan.md` under `## Project Charter`.
- Story goals live in the active spec under `### Goal Contract`.
- `docs/Context/` is supporting context only; it is not the goal source of truth.

### Goal Contract Fields

Every project or story Goal Contract must capture:

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Goal | The end state the user actually wants |
| User outcome | Who benefits and what changes for them |
| Success condition | The measurable condition that means the goal is done |
| Proof / evidence | Tests, review evidence, smoke result, demo, metric, or artifact used to prove completion |
| Non-goals | Explicit exclusions that prevent scope creep |
| Assumptions | Important assumptions the agent is relying on |
| Risks | Delivery, quality, security, or product risks |
| Unresolved questions | Open questions, or `None` |

### Clarification Rules

1. Infer first from the user's prompt, codebase, `docs/Master-Plan.md`, active specs, and `docs/Context/`.
2. Ask one question at a time. Never ask the next question until the previous answer is received.
3. Build each next question from the original request and previous answers.
4. Ask only about fields that are missing, vague, contradictory, or risky.
5. Stop when the Goal Contract is clear enough to generate acceptance criteria, implementation tasks, review findings, and ship evidence.
6. If `/agtoosa-init` reaches 12 goal/context questions and clarity is still insufficient, stop and ask whether to continue the interview or proceed with documented assumptions.
7. `/agtoosa-goal check` and `/agtoosa-update check` are read-only; they may report gaps and suggest `/agtoosa-goal`, but they must not update files. Full `/agtoosa-update` requires explicit approval before Apply and uses `agtoosa.sh --update` as the mutation source of truth.

## Smart Interview Protocol

All AgToosa commands that require user input follow this shared protocol. It is designed to be efficient — never overwhelming — and always ends with an explicit approval gate.

### Principles

| Principle | Rule |
|-----------|------|
| **Infer first, ask second** | Scan the codebase, `docs/Master-Plan.md`, active specs, and `docs/Context/` before forming any question. If an answer is inferable with high confidence (≥80%), state it as a finding — do not ask. A detailed user prompt is input, not interview completion. |
| **Minimum validation floor** | Full `/agtoosa-spec`: at least **2** validation questions before writing spec files (cap **8**). `/agtoosa-spec quick`: at least **1** (cap **2**). Exception: user explicitly opts into documented assumptions after a research summary. |
| **Interview turn-stop** | After research, end the turn on the first interview question. Do not write spec files, test plans, Master-Plan enrollments, or build artifacts in the same turn as Q1. |
| **Options from context** | When asking, derive 2–3 options from what was found in the codebase or research. Mark one as recommended. Always allow free-text override. |
| **One question at a time** | Never present the next question until the previous answer is received. |
| **Bounded question budgets** | Respect the per-command maximum listed below. Quality over quantity. |
| **Adaptive follow-ups** | Each answer may trigger at most one follow-up question. Never branch into multiple follow-up threads. |
| **Approval gate always** | Even if zero questions were asked, end every phase with an explicit approval gate before proceeding. **Exception:** when the phase was **dispatched by `/agtoosa-next`**, the user's Next invocation counts as approval when readiness checks pass (see `docs/AgToosa_Next.md` → Sequential Approval Contract). |

### Question Format

```
❓ [Question — one sentence]
  → A) [Option derived from codebase or research] ← recommended
  → B) [Alternative option]
  → C) [Alternative option]
  Or type your own answer.
```

- If only one option is obvious: state it as a recommendation and ask to confirm or override.
- If no options are derivable: open-ended question only, no options block.
- Never present more than 3 options per question.

### Approval Gate Format

After completing a phase (even when zero questions were asked), always present:

```
✅ Ready to proceed
[1–3 sentence summary of what was determined or produced.]
→ Approve to continue  |  Comment or make changes below
```

Wait for the user's explicit approval before starting the next phase or writing any output files.

### Question Budgets per Command

| Command | Max questions | Notes |
|---------|--------------|-------|
| `/agtoosa-init` | 12 before continue gate | Goal discovery plus Context setup; if clarity is still missing after 12 questions, ask whether to continue or proceed with documented assumptions |
| `/agtoosa-spec` | 8 (adaptive) | Plan-Mode Spec Interview: research first, infer before asking; minimum validation floor **2** before spec write (quick floor **1**); interview turn-stop after Q1; if still unclear after 8 core questions, ask continue or proceed with documented assumptions; `/agtoosa-spec quick` cap **2**; Part 4 task planning is auto-derived from the approved spec |
| `/agtoosa-build` | 0 | Execution phase — task list is already approved as part of `/agtoosa-spec`. Discovery Triage may surface mid-build questions but is not a budgeted gate. |
| `/agtoosa-task` | 3 | Type + priority + context; type+priority can merge into one |
| `/agtoosa-qa` | 0 | Execution phase — approval gate only |
| `/agtoosa-review` | 0 | Execution phase — verdict approval gate only |
| `/agtoosa-ship` | 0 | Execution phase — deploy approval gate only |
| `/agtoosa-status` | 0 | Read-only — no interaction needed |

### Project Intake Protocol

> **Claim Boundary:** agent-instructed (docs + always-on rules). Not a runtime orchestrator.

When the user sends a **freeform** request without an explicit `/agtoosa-*` (or named `agtoosa-*`) command, run **AgToosa Project Intake** before product changes:

1. **Read** `docs/Context/workflow.md` → `## Standing Corrections` (if present).
2. **Classify** soft vs hard using Claim-Boundary triggers below.
3. **Route** to exactly one primary destination; **expedite** the user's ask once soft-routed or hard-confirmed.
4. **Never** auto-chain Spec → Build → Review → Ship (Phase Stop preserved).

**Slash wins:** explicit `/agtoosa-*` bypasses intake ceremony; run the named workflow (Standing Corrections still apply as project memory).

**Soft path** (quiet one-liner, e.g. `Intake: soft → /agtoosa-task — expediting.`):

- Local bug/chore/debug cleanup, &lt;15 min, single-file or clearly local
- In-scope incomplete Active Task → continue under `/agtoosa-build`
- Tiny regression owned by current In Review story → review finding or Active Tasks sub-task for next `/agtoosa-review`

**Hard path** — do **not** modify product/implementation code until the user confirms. Present benefit-framed copy:

```text
**AgToosa Project Intake** — This change is bigger than a quick fix.
Routing it through /agtoosa-spec keeps it on the Master Plan, captures
Standing Corrections when needed, and prevents an untracked AI edit from
drifting the product. Confirm to open Spec, or say how you want to override.
```

**Hard-gate triggers (Claim-Boundary sized):** new feature/architecture; multi-primary-surface coordinated change; security/trust boundary; Active Cycle conflict; scope expand without Spec Approved.

**Destination map (pick one):**

| Signal | Destination |
|--------|-------------|
| Local bug/chore/debug | Expedite now; `/agtoosa-task` if tracking needed |
| Regression from current cycle | Review finding or sub-task for `/agtoosa-review` |
| In-scope Active Task | `/agtoosa-build` rules for that story |
| New feature / architecture / security / cycle conflict | Stop → `/agtoosa-spec` (or `quick`) after confirm |
| Out of charter / noise | Factor out or Backlog spike — confirm if unsure |

**Standing Corrections:** when the user states an always/never rule or confirms a hard-gate lesson, append a dated deduped row under `## Standing Corrections` in `docs/Context/workflow.md`.

**Tiered logging:** soft path — response one-liner only; write Master-Plan/Update Log only if `/agtoosa-task` or Backlog entry created. Hard path — record confirmed decision (task, scope note, Update Log, or deferred-to-spec) after user confirm.

**Mid-build:** out-of-scope discoveries during `/agtoosa-build` still use Discovery Triage below — not Project Intake.

#### AgToosa Lifecycle Compass

> Extends **Project Intake** (soft/hard gate above). Every freeform ask finds its place on **Spec → Build → Review → Ship**.

When the user omits `/agtoosa-*`, run **AgToosa Lifecycle Compass** after Project Intake Standing Corrections read:

1. Run `bash agtoosa.sh --status-line [path]` (or `agtoosa.ps1 -StatusLine`; fallback: read Master-Plan Active Cycle).
2. Infer **semantic intent** from the utterance (not phrase-table lookup): `PLAN` · `BUILD` · `REVIEW` · `SHIP` · `FIX` · `EXPLORE` · `TRACK` · `PROGRESS`.
3. Apply Claim Boundary soft/hard (intake triggers above).
4. **Reconcile** intent × SYNC `next` × hard triggers → exactly one **ANCHOR** (`spec` · `build` · `review` · `ship` · `none`).
5. Route to the matching workflow; **Phase Stop** preserved.

**Branded lines (normative):**

| Path | Line |
|------|------|
| Soft | `Compass: soft → <phase> — <rationale>` |
| Hard gate | `**AgToosa Lifecycle Compass** — <benefit>. ANCHOR: <phase> — confirm /agtoosa-<phase>.` |
| Tributary | `Compass: tributary (<explore\|fix\|track>) → serving <phase> · <story-id\|none>` then `When done: return to /agtoosa-<phase> — <rationale>` |
| Progress | `Compass: progress → /agtoosa-next — <SYNC one-liner>` |

**Semantic classes → ANCHOR** (examples illustrative, not exhaustive):

| Class | Meaning | ANCHOR | Workflow |
|-------|---------|--------|----------|
| PLAN | New capability, architecture, scope expand | `spec` | `/agtoosa-spec` |
| BUILD | Implement approved work, finish tasks | `build` | `/agtoosa-build` |
| REVIEW | Audit, check quality, PR review | `review` | `/agtoosa-review` |
| SHIP | Release, deploy, publish | `ship` | `/agtoosa-ship` |
| FIX | Claim-Boundary-small bug/chore | active phase | tributary → expedite |
| EXPLORE | Read-only questions | active phase | tributary → answer |
| TRACK | Log backlog item | `spec` | tributary → `/agtoosa-task` |
| PROGRESS | Advance lifecycle without naming a phase | `none` (dispatcher) | `/agtoosa-next` |

**Continuation Context Contract** (PROGRESS-class utterances — semantic, not phrase-table):

Illustrative examples: `next`, `continue`, `okay`, `ok`, `do it`, `go ahead`, `sounds good`, `yes`, `proceed`, `let's go`, `keep going`, `what's next`, `agtoosa next`.

| Priority | Condition | Action |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Agent asked a **pending interview question** (Plan-Mode Spec Interview, budget menu, hard-gate confirm) | Answer or momentum opt-in per `AgToosa_Spec.md` — **do not** dispatch `/agtoosa-next` |
| 2 | Agent printed **closure** (`Next: /agtoosa-next`) or **approval gate** at phase end | Dispatch **`/agtoosa-next`** (Sequential Approval when served) |
| 3 | **Bare continuation** + active SYNC cycle | Dispatch **`/agtoosa-next`** |
| 4 | Low confidence | One multiple-choice: `(A) Advance via /agtoosa-next` `(B) Answer pending question` `(C) Something else` |

Never substitute a raw phase slash (`/agtoosa-build`, `/agtoosa-ship`, etc.) when the user only expressed PROGRESS intent — always run the `/agtoosa-next` routing algorithm first.

### PROGRESS vs `/agtoosa-help next` disambiguation

| User input | Route | Mutates? |
|------------|-------|----------|
| Bare `next`, `do it`, `okay`, `continue`, etc. (PROGRESS intent) | **`/agtoosa-next`** — execute dispatched workflow | Yes (one phase) |
| Explicit `/agtoosa-help next` or `/agtoosa-next dry` | Preview only — same routing, no execution | No |
| Explicit `/agtoosa-next` | Execute dispatched workflow | Yes (one phase) |

**Anti-pattern:** Do **not** treat freeform `next` as `/agtoosa-help next`. Help preview is for **explicit** help invocations only. After printing `Next: /agtoosa-next`, a bare `next` or `do it` **executes** Next — it does not re-run help preview.

| Condition | Route |
|-----------|-------|
| PLAN or hard-sized ask | Hard gate → ANCHOR `spec` |
| BUILD intent + SYNC `next /agtoosa-spec` | Explain mismatch → ANCHOR `spec`; do not code |
| BUILD intent + active tasks remain | ANCHOR `build` |
| REVIEW intent + tasks complete | ANCHOR `review` |
| SHIP intent + review not done | ANCHOR `review` first |
| PROGRESS intent (continuation utterance) | Route to `/agtoosa-next` — not a raw phase slash; apply Continuation Context Contract |
| Low confidence | One multiple-choice question (plan / build / fix / review) |

Explicit `/agtoosa-*` bypasses Compass ceremony. **IDE Host Mode Bridge:** for `/agtoosa-spec` and `/agtoosa-review`, **prefer native IDE plan mode** during planning windows (see below and `docs/AgToosa_AgentCapability.md` → **IDE Host Mode Matrix**). Execute AgToosa workflow files inside that mode. Switch to Agent/Auto only at the auto-switch trigger. Other phases (`/agtoosa-build`, `/agtoosa-ship`, freeform coding) default to Agent/Auto unless the user explicitly requests plan. On hard-path confirm, begin the named workflow immediately; Compass is not permission to skip it. Never auto-chain Spec → Build → Review → Ship.

### IDE Host Mode Bridge

Maps AgToosa spec and review planning phases onto native IDE plan modes, then auto-switches to Agent/Auto for artifact writes. Canonical detail: `docs/AgToosa_Spec.md` and `docs/AgToosa_Review.md` → **IDE Host Mode Bridge**; per-platform enter/switch: `docs/AgToosa_AgentCapability.md` → **IDE Host Mode Matrix**.

| Phase command | Native plan-mode window | Agent/Auto window |

| `/agtoosa-spec` (full) | Research, Plan-Mode Spec Interview, Goal Contract, architecture/STRIDE as plan artifact | Write `docs/archived/spec-*.md`, test plan, Master-Plan enrollment, approval marker |
| `/agtoosa-spec research` | Entire sub-command | — |
| `/agtoosa-spec quick` | Interview (cap 2) + plan draft | Spec file + tasks |
| `/agtoosa-review` (full) | Persona analysis, Iron Law hypotheses, cross-model gate planning, findings synthesis | Write `review-*.md`, Master-Plan status, simplification refactors, verdict gate |
| `/agtoosa-review debug` | Hypothesis + reproduction plan | Regression test + fix (build tributary) |

**Auto-switch trigger** (all required): decision-complete checklist satisfied **or** user opts into documented assumptions; minimum validation floor met (spec: 2 full / 1 quick); no pending interview question or budget menu; print before first artifact write:

```
HOST-MODE: plan complete → switching to agent for AgToosa artifacts
```

**Never auto-switch** mid-interview, on PROGRESS utterances (`okay`, `do it`), or before user confirms assumptions. Finish the current plan-mode turn before switching — do not queue mixed-mode requests.

### Discovery Triage Protocol

During `/agtoosa-build`, when the agent notices anything outside the declared scope:

1. **Classify** — Bug / Chore / Feature / Security?
2. **Size** — Can it be fixed in < 15 min without scope creep? If yes → fix it now and note it in the build summary. If no → step 3.
3. **Ask the user** — "I found [brief description]. Should I: (A) add to Master-Plan.md Backlog for later, (B) add to current scope, or (C) ignore?"
4. **If A** — run `/agtoosa-task`; add `Discovered during /agtoosa-build on [Story ID] on [date]` to the description; record in `docs/Master-Plan.md` under `## Backlog`.
5. **If B** — update the Scope Boundary in the active spec; create a new Task sub-issue under the Story; continue TDD cycle.

Never silently fix or drop an out-of-scope discovery.

### Lifecycle Next-Step Contract

After **successful** completion of `/agtoosa-spec` (post-approval tasks slice), `/agtoosa-build`, `/agtoosa-review`, or `/agtoosa-ship`:

1. Print a **primary lifecycle next-step** line — **not** `/agtoosa-status` as the headline:

    ```
    ✅ Done. Next: /agtoosa-next — <one-line rationale>
    ```

    For sequential users, `/agtoosa-next` is the default handoff (it reads SYNC and dispatches the underlying phase). Advanced users may still invoke phase commands directly.

    Underlying phase order: Spec approved → build; build complete → review; review approved → ship; ship / idle → spec for next story.

2. Print an automatic **executive SYNC pulse** (same format as CLI):

    ```
    SYNC: <story-id|none> · <status> · tasks N/M · clarity <tags|—> · next </agtoosa-command>
    ```

    Prefer `bash agtoosa.sh --status-line [path]` (or `agtoosa.ps1 -StatusLine`) when available; otherwise read `docs/Master-Plan.md` read-only.

3. Optional tertiary only when useful: `Optional: /agtoosa-status for full health findings.`

**Interview soft cap (Plan-Mode Spec Interview):** default **8**, then **+4**; when the user types new free-text directions, **+4 may repeat** until Decision-complete — not a hard stop at 8.

### Phase Stop Contract

AgToosa has no hard workflow engine — phase boundaries are enforced by instruction following. Every command and platform adapter must honor this contract:

| Rule | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| **Spec ends at approval gate** | `/agtoosa-spec` (full flow or `tasks`) may create the spec, task tree, and test plan skeleton, then **must stop** at the approval gate — unless **served by `/agtoosa-next`** (Sequential Approval Contract). |
| **No auto-build** | Do **not** invoke or chain into `/agtoosa-build` unless the user explicitly runs `/agtoosa-build` after approval — or `/agtoosa-next` dispatches build after spec approval in a **separate** invocation. |
| **Approval marks readiness only** | Appending `## ✅ Spec Approved` records sign-off; it does not start build in the same invocation. |
| **Next-served approval** | When `/agtoosa-next` dispatches a phase, the user's Next invocation counts as approval at spec, review, and ship deploy gates when readiness checks pass. Still **one phase per Next** — never chain phases in one run. |
| **Prerequisite failures stop** | When `/agtoosa-build`, `/agtoosa-review`, or `/agtoosa-qa` prerequisites are unmet, **stop** and tell the user the exact next command. Do **not** auto-run another phase on their behalf. |

### Terminal Evidence Contract

Every completed build task, test run, security scan, QA execution, review check, or parallel subagent must report terminal evidence before the orchestrator marks work done:

| Field | Required |
|-------|----------|
| Command run | Exact command(s) executed |
| Exit code | `0` or nonzero |
| Result | `pass` or `fail` |
| Warnings | Lint, markdownlint, or tool warnings — or `none` |
| Errors | stderr / failure summary — or `none` |
| Changed files | Paths touched |
| Next action | What the orchestrator should do next |

**Blocking rules:**

- A nonzero exit code blocks task completion unless classified as accepted/pre-existing with evidence.
- Lint warnings, markdownlint warnings, and failing tests block completion unless explicitly accepted with evidence.
- The orchestrator must summarize unresolved terminal output before marking checkboxes done in `docs/Master-Plan.md` or the active spec.

**Parallel subagents** (e.g. Claude Code `Task` tool during `/agtoosa-build` or `/agtoosa-review`): each subagent returns the full evidence block above; the orchestrator merges results, resolves conflicts, and does not check off tasks until all blocking terminal output is resolved or explicitly accepted.

> **Related — Delivery Evidence Contract:** Minimum evidence by delivery class (Guided / Evidenced / Enforced profiles) lives in `docs/AgToosa_Delivery_Evidence_Contract.md` and optional `.agtoosa/evidence.yml`. That contract is **not** a rename of this Terminal Evidence Contract — keep both.

## Rules

1. **Always** read `docs/Context/`, `docs/Master-Plan.md`, `docs/Master-Architecture.md`, and `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` (if present) before generating code. Use `Master-Plan.md` as the cycle/backlog snapshot and `Master-Architecture.md` as the architecture snapshot.
2. **Never** assume dependency versions from memory — verify via web or terminal.
3. **Always** keep `docs/Master-Plan.md` up to date after every phase — it is the source of truth.
4. **Always** follow the TDD Red-Green-Refactor cycle during `/agtoosa-build` (if enabled).
5. **Never** let a code file exceed 500 lines.
6. **Always** archive completed work to `docs/archived/` during `/agtoosa-ship`.
7. **Always** record a phase-transition note at each phase boundary using the Phase Comment Protocol above (Master-Plan Update Log + `docs/agtoosa-events.jsonl` by default; issue comments only when external issues exist).
8. **Always** triage any out-of-scope discovery during `/agtoosa-build` using the Discovery Triage Protocol above. Never silently fix or drop an out-of-scope finding.
9. **Verify before claiming.** `bash docs/agtoosa-verify.sh` is the deterministic lifecycle gate — run it before declaring a build complete or a story ship-ready, and fix FAIL findings first.
